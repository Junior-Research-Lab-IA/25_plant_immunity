## Does social regulation of plant immunity exist ?

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
This project investigates whether plants can exhibit a form of herd immunity similar to social insects like bees. The idea is that plants growing in dense patches might collectively regulate their immune responses, reducing individual costs and optimizing growth. The study compares patch-forming grasses with more dispersed species through biomass, infrared, and metabolomic analyses. The goal is to determine if community-level immunity exists in plants and explore how this could be applied in agriculture to improve disease resistance and ecosystem resilience.
