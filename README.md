## When neighbours matter: Context-dependent effects of neighbour identity on plant growth–immunity trade-offs


Intraspecific varietal mixtures are increasingly promoted as an agroecological strategy to improve disease regulation in plant communities. Even though research has shown that neighbor-modulated susceptibility (NMS), a process by which plant–plant interactions influence disease responses, is relevant, it has focused almost exclusively on cultivated species—mainly wheat and rice—and the magnitude and direction of NMS effects vary across species. Here, we tested whether recognition of a genetically related neighbour (kin) versus a conspecific of different origin (stranger) influences plant immunity. 

This question was addressed across a wide range of grass species, including 14 wild species and 9 cultivated varieties. These species span both ecological gradients, contrasting patchy and non-patchy spatial strategies, and evolutionary gradients, distinguishing wild from domesticated plants. For each species or cultivar, focal plants were grown with either a kin or a stranger. We measured phenotypic traits that allow us to proxy how plants reallocate energy between growth and immune responses. Because immune activation often constrains vegetative growth, the growth–immunity trade-off provides an indirect way to assess defence investment. 

At the global scale, neighbour identity had no significant effect on any measured trait. However, several species exhibited strong but contrasting kin–stranger responses, indicating species-specific and context-dependent effects rather than a generalized pattern. Ecological and evolutionary gradients strongly structured plant phenotypes but did not explain variation in neighbour-related responses. Our results suggest that understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential modulation of the growth–immunity trade-off will be essential to clarify how plant–plant interactions influence immune regulation.
